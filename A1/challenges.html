	<h2>Standards</h2>
		<p>
			Standards are very important as they lend uniformity to the areas of creation and consumption i.e. for developers and visitors of websites/machines or programs reading the page.  
		</p>
		<p>
			When developers follow standards, it is easier for them to know what to expect from a particular piece of code that they write and also to understand each other's code easily.
		</p>
		<p>	
			Standards are also important from a machine learning perspective, as they make it a lot easier for machines/other programs to read and process information.
		</p>
		<p>	
			For example, if standards are followed, the uniformity enables ease of access to various users.
			Not only does this mean allowing the web to be used by people with disabilities, but also allowing web pages to be understood by people using browsers other than the usual ones â€“ including voice browsers that read web pages aloud to people with sight impairments, Braille browsers that translate text into Braille, hand-held browsers with very little monitor space, teletext displays, and other unusual output devices.
		</p>
	<h2>Doctype</h2>
		<p>
			Doctype tells the browser about the version and standards/grammar of the html being used for a page. I used the Doctype "HTML" as I wanted to try some HTML5 tags.
