			The web has always amazed me, esp. so because I spend most of my waking life in and around it. So, I got curious to know what goes on behind the scenes and how does it really work. I like to call it the world wizard coz it seems to know everything ;) and one of my interactions with the world wizard led me to discover a <a href="http://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/courses/153">course</a> being offered about the wonders of this world wizard, this summer at Berkeley. So I decided to take it and widen my perspective of how www (wonder of the world wizard) works and learn more about WWW (World Wide Web)

			I have had one week of class so far and things look pretty darn cool !! Turns out that we will be able to build our own website by the end of the course. We even have a <a href="http://courses.ischool.berkeley.edu/i153/su12/">course website</a> to keep track of stuff we are learning.
